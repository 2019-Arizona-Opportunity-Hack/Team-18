Our application allows useres to create an oline version of any document such as a voter form. This automatically links the non-programmer to the backend in a specific format

## Getting Started

The component app is in the client folder and it has two major components, CreateForm and ListAdder. 

## Installation

Run the following to install in your local react project and copy the two components over.
